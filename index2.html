            <h4>Inspiration</h4>
            <p>I like to take every little aspect of an experience or situation and disect how I can use it to
                make myself a better programmer. I use this technique in every aspect of life as it helps to broaden my creativity
                and logical thinking to apply to different programming problems!

            <h4>Support Systems</h4>
            <p>I would not be here if it was not for my amazingly supportive family - my mother, especially. Every succes story
                has a group a people behind the scenes that deserve recognigtion for supporting and encouraging them. I would not
                be who I am today if not for them!

                what she has done and continues to do for me throughout my software development journey! My mother is hero and everyday I aspire to
