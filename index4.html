            <h3>MUSIC</h3>
            <p>Whenever I decide to take a break from coding I usually turn to one of my first loves - the trumpet. Reading music is very
                stimulating and the sounds produced help sooth my mind!!

            <h3>PAINTING</h3>
            <p>Painting is so much fun and relaxing. I use it to express myself and ideas and I love how fast time moves when I'm 
                focused on drawing and painting!

            <h3>SCHOOLING</h3>
            <p>I attend Atlanta Technical College. I am a second-semester freshman and currently have a 4.0 gpa. I am targeting my Associate's 
                and major in Computer Infortmation Technology. I've been learning to code for 4 months and can honestly say that I've never
                been happier than when I am perfecting my programming skills!!!

            <p>I am 21 years of age and absolutely love staying active. Home workout curcuits have been apart of life for a very long time
                and are the jumpstart to my days!

            <h2>Take a Trip into Software Development!</h2>
            <p>Coding is what I go to sleep thinking about and
                what I wake up thinking about. I've been coding for 4 months at this point and 
                have absolutely fallen in love with the process of problem solving and learning shorter and more efficient 
                ways to solve real-world problems. What drives this passion is that
                 I know that I am intelligent because I know that I am not. I learn from my mistakes and even more so
                 when learning from others, so I won't have to directly experience something in order to know it's incorrect.
                 I have the drive and passion for coding that I believe is unmatched and more than willing to demonstrate my
                 love for software development! Thank you so much for looking 
                through my first ever website as this is just a stepping stone of my software development career!!!
